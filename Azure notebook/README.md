My machine learning code is contained in the Internet_ads.ipynb. The aim is to try to predict whether an internet image is an advertisement or not based on features such as width, length... (refer to documentation for more info re this) of the image. It involves data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, model building and model evaluation. 

The dataset is downloaded from the UCI repository and can be accessed here - "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase".
